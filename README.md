## Introduction
This is a code repository for the corresponding video tutorial - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6QREj8te1P7VSwhrMf3D3Xt4V6_SRkhu.

Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB you'll learn how to build a Full Stack MERN Application - from start to finish. The App is called "Memories" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

By the end of this video, you will have a strong understanding of how the MERN Stack works.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app

TODO: rename post message, refactor reducers, add some cool memories, maybe clickable tags, fix update functionality


first: Add path to the app.js for search and post details
SECOND: create component for pagination and post details

GETPOSTBYSEARCH => search => getpostbysearch action =>communicate with the backend (controller) => return data back to user

GETPOST BY PAGINATION=> useeffect => get action =>communicate with the backend (controller) => dispatch all data and loading=> send data back to user

OPEN POST => Post details component
